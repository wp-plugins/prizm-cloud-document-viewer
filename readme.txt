Prizm Viewer is free for use for any website with less than 5,000 page views per month. However, if the website has over 2,000 page views per month Accusoft reserves the right to insert advertisements of less than 5 seconds randomly between page views. If you have a commercial website or application, or need advanced controls, API access and no ads, the Prizm Viewer Premium Edition is a cost-effective solution with an extended feature set and customization capabilities. For over 20,000 page views per month you will need Prizm Viewer Elite Edition.
